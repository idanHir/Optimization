Each group gets two articles with two learners
The goal is to implement them
However, just implementing will barely manage to scratch a passing grade
The point to the think creatively -
See how we can take the two learners we got in the articles, and make them more interesting:
* Change the features
* Change the learn rate
* Do stuff that are learned differently
* we are NOT expected to change the network itself
* we ARE expected to change the parameters the optimizers receive
(Generally) The first learner is supposed to be first order, and the second is second order
We need to improve the learners and achieve a low loss with them
DONT OVERFIT - Moral tests the optimizers on a different dataset
